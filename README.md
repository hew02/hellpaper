 <p align="center">A wallpaper picker for Linux, built with Raylib.</p>
</p>

## "Features"

*   **Multiple Layouts**: Switch between four different animated layouts (Grid, Horizontal River, Vertical River, Wave).
*   **Live Search**: Filter wallpapers instantly by typing.
*   **Full-Screen Preview**: Isolate and preview a single wallpaper.
*   **GPU-Accelerated Effects**: Add optional, configurable visual effects for startup, key presses, and exit.
*   **Total Customization**: Every color, animation speed, and behavior can be configured in an external text **.conf** file.

## Dependencies

*   **raylib**

## Building

Just run: 

```bash
make
```
This creates `hellpaper` executable. If you run `make install`, it will be installed in `/usr/local/bin`

## Usage

The basic command runs the picker, pointing it to a directory of images. Upon selection, it prints the full path of the chosen wallpaper to standard output.

```bash
./hellpaper [OPTIONS] [PATH_TO_WALLPAPERS]
```

If no path is provided, it defaults to `~/Pictures/`.

## Configuration

Hellpaper is fully configurable via a plain text file located at:
`~/.config/hellpaper/hellpaper.conf`

The application will create the directory on first run if it doesn't exist. If the config file is not found, default values will be used.

Here is a template `hellpaper.conf` with all available options:

```ini
# Hellpaper Configuration File
# Lines starting with # or ; are comments.

[Theme]
# Colors are defined as R, G, B, A (0-255)
bg = 10, 10, 15, 255
idle = 30, 30, 46, 255
hover = 49, 50, 68, 255
border = 203, 166, 247, 255
ripple = 245, 194, 231, 255
overlay = 10, 10, 15, 200
text = 202, 212, 241, 255

[Settings]
# The maximum number of wallpapers to load from the directory.
max_wallpapers = 512
# The base size of the square thumbnail images.
base_thumb_size = 150
# The base padding between thumbnails.
base_padding = 15
# The thickness of the glowing border on hover.
border_thickness_bloom = 3.0
# The number of threads to use for loading thumbnail images.
max_threads = 8
# The speed of all layout and hover animations. Higher is faster.
anim_speed = 20.0
# The number of particles to emit on selection.
particle_count = 50
# The duration of the Ken Burns (pan/zoom) effect in preview mode.
ken_burns_duration = 15.0
# The maximum frames per second.
max_fps = 200

[Effects]
# Available effects: none, glitch, blur, pixelate, shake, collapse, reveal
startup_effect = blur
keypress_effect = none
exit_effect = glitch
```

## Integration Examples

You can pipe the output of `hellpaper` directly into your favorite wallpaper setting command.

### Wayland Compositors

```bash
# Select a wallpaper and immediately set it with swaybg
swaybg -i "$(./hellpaper ~/Wallpapers)" -m fill
```

```bash
# With swww
swww img "$(./hellpaper ~/Pictures)"
```

### For X11 (using feh)

```bash
# Select a wallpaper and immediately set it with feh
feh --bg-fill "$(./hellpaper_x11 ~/Wallpapers)"
```

### In a Shell Script

You can create a simple script to make this even easier.

**`setwall.sh`**
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env sh

WALLPAPER_DIR=~/Pictures/
SELECTED_WALL=$(./hellpaper "$WALLPAPER_DIR")

# Exit if no wallpaper was selected (e.g., user pressed ESC)
if [ -z "$SELECTED_WALL" ]; then
    echo "No wallpaper selected."
    exit 1
fi

swww img "$SELECTED_WALL"
```

## Hellwal Integration

Since I also created [hellwal](https://github.com/danihek/hellwal), I thought it would be nice to use colors from hellwal in **hellpaper** so here is a template, and example "**setwallpaper**" script:

**`hellpaper.conf`**
```ini
# Hellpaper Hellwal template config
[Theme]
bg = %% color0.rgb %%, 255
idle = %% color1.rgb %%, 255
hover = %% color15.rgb %%, 255
border = %% color7.rgb %%, 255
ripple = %% color4.rgb %%, 255
text = %% color14.rgb %%, 255

[Settings]
base_thumb_size = 120
base_padding = 10
anim_speed = 20.0
particle_count = 100
max_fps = 200

[Effects]
# Valid effects: none, glitch, blur, pixelate, shake, collapse, reveal
startup_effect = blur
keypress_effect = none
exit_effect = collapse
```

**`setwallpaper.sh`**
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env sh

WALLPAPER_DIR=~/Pictures/
SELECTED_WALL=$(./hellpaper "$WALLPAPER_DIR")

if [ -z "$SELECTED_WALL" ]; then
    echo "No wallpaper selected."
    exit 1
fi

# Generate colors from wallpaper
hellwal -i "$SELECTED_WALL" --neon-mode

# Fetch variables
source ~/.cache/hellwal/variables.sh

# Set wallpaper using swww
swww img $SELECTED_WALL

# Set colors for Hellpaper
cp ~/.cache/hellwal/hellpaper.conf ~/.config/hellpaper/hellpaper.conf

# Set colors for rofi
cp ~/.cache/hellwal/rofi.rasi ~/.config/rofi/config.rasi

# ... accordingly for other apps

```
